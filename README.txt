General

Don't push to master.

Add Makefile or build.ninja so your binaries can be built easily.
* With Makefile, use `make -j` to build everything,
  and `make clean` to delete built files
  (which have to be listed explicitly).
* With build.ninja, use `ninja` to build everything,
  and `ninja -t clean` to delete built files.

However, if you speak Tex or MathJax,
please typeset your numbers/variables/equations in such formats.
