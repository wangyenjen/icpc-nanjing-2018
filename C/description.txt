Cherry and Chocolate
====================
Cherry and Chocolate plays a game on a tree.
First, Cherry picks a node and paint it pink.
Then, Chocolate picks another node and paint it brown.
Afterwards, Cherry picks yet another node and paint it pink.
The game ends here. Chocolate doesn't get a second move.

For each node $v$,
if there is no path from $v$ to the brown node without
passing through a pink node, Cherry get a point.

Cherry wants to maximize her score,
and Chocolate wants to minimize it.
If both player play optimally,
what will Cherry's score be?

($1 \le a_i, b_i \le n$),
meaning there is an edge between node $a_i$ and node $b_i$.

A single integer,
