Pyramid
============

The use of the triangle in the New Age practices seems to be very important as it represents the unholy trinity (Satan, the Antichrist and the False Prophet bringing mankind to the New World Order with false/distorted beliefs). The triangle is of primary importance in all Illuminati realms, whether in the ritual ceremonies of the Rosicrucians and Masons or the witchcraft, astrological and black magic practices of other Illuminati followers.

One day you found out that a pyramid contains many regular triangles, which is very evil and unacceptable. You want to calculate the number of regular triangles in a big pyramid, so that you can estimate the strength of Illuminati.
