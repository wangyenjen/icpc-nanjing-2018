Easy Problem
============

Given a graph, decide if the graph is a tree.

Input
-----
The first line contains two integers,
$n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n, m, \le 10^6$) ---
the number of vertices and the number of edges.

Each of the next $m$ lines contains two integers $a$ and $b$,
($1 \le a, b \le n$),
meaning there are an edge between vertex $a$ and vertex $b$.

Output
------
`"Yes"` (without the quotes) if the number is a tree;
`"No"` otherwise.
