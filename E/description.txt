Eddy and Euro coins
===================
Eddy is fond of collecting coins.
Whenever he visit a different country,
he always picks up as many local coins as he can.
As you know, Eddy also likes to go trip to Europe;
thus he has collected a large amount of Euro coins because so many countries in Europe use them.

Eddy has $n$ Euro coins in total.
He places all his coins on a desk in a row and plays a game with the coins.
In one step Eddy can choose exactly $k$ consecutive coins, heads of which all face up or all face down,
and flip them at the same time.
Eddy wonders that, in finite steps, what states of the coins can be reached from the original state.

Input
-----
The first line contains two integers,
$n$ and $k$ ($1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^6$) ---
the number of Euro coins Eddy owns and the number of consecutive coins Eddy can flip in one step.
The second and third line each contains a string, $s$ and $t$, respectively ($|s| = |t| = n$).
$s$ and $t$ only contains the digits `0` and `1`.

$s$ represents the initial state of the $n$ coins:
if the head of the $i$-th coin face up, then the $i$-th character of $s$ is $1$;
otherwise (i.e. the head of $i$-th coin face down), the $i$-th character of $s$ is $0$.
$t$ represents the desired final state of the $n$ coins in the same way as $s$.

Output
------
If it is possible to reach the state represented by $t$ from the state represented by $s$ in finite steps,
output `"Yes"` (without the quotes); otherwise, output `"No"`.
